# BDD Enterprise Reporting

The aim of this project is to create a centralised view of all 
projects in an organisation that use BDD tooling such as Cucumber 
or SpecFlow.

Although the the output from each of these tools provides the information
needed, it doesn't provide a consolidated view of all projects which makes
it easy for organisations to see the overall quality of the software they
are creating.

This project is still very much in the early stages of development and features
will be implemented based on end customer requirements. If there is some feature
that you would like from the tool then please raise a request.
